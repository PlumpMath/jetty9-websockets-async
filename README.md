jetty9-websockets-async
==========

A [WebSocketServlet] for Jetty 9 that offloads WebSocket communication
to `core.async` channels.

This is heavily inspired by [jetty7-websockets-async].

## Supported Clojure Versions ##

jetty9-websockets-async is tested on Clojure 1.5.1 only.  It may work
on other Clojure versions.

## Maturity ##

This is alpha quality software.

## Installation ##

jetty9-websockets-async is available as a Maven artifact from
[Clojars]:

```clojure
[org.tobereplaced/jetty9-websockets-async "0.2.0"]
```

jetty9-websockets-async follows [Semantic Versioning].  Please note
that this means the public API for this library is not yet considered
stable.

## Documentation ##

Please read the [Codox API Documentation], as it contains all of the
information you would like to know.

## Usage ##

I generally don't believe in wrapping libraries because doing so often
makes them less flexible.  In this particular case, I can't possibly
know all of the things you want to do with your web server.
Consequently, instead of making a `configurator` for
`ring-jetty-adapter`, I have exposed a function you can use to create
a [WebSocketServlet] or a [WebSocketClient] that offloads
communication onto `core.async` channels.  What you do with it is up
to you.

If you're looking for example code embedding this servlet in an
application, the complete [unit tests] may be of interest.

If you absolutely promise not to make your production code look anything
like below...

```clojure
(def channel-fn #(chan 45))
(def comm (channel-fn))

(def server
  "A running web server accepting websockets."
  (let [holder (ServletHolder. ^Servlet (servlet comm channel-fn channel-fn))
        handler (doto (ServletContextHandler.) (.addServlet holder "/*"))]
    (doto (Server. 8080) (.setHandler handler) .start)))

(def client-read-channel (channel-fn))
(def client-write-channel (channel-fn))

(def client
  "A running WebSocketClient."
  (doto (WebSocketClient.) .start))

(def client-connection
  "A connection map for the client."
  (<!! (connect! client
                 (URI. "ws://localhost:8080/")
                 client-read-channel client-write-channel)))

(>!! client-write-channel "PING")
(let [{:keys [read-channel write-channel]} (<!! comm)]
    (assert (= "PING" (<!! read-channel)))
    (>!! write-channel "PONG"))
(assert (= "PONG" (<!! client-read-channel)))
```

## Support ##

Please post any comments, concerns, or issues to the Github issues
page or find me on `#clojure`.  I welcome any and all feedback.
